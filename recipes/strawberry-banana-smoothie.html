        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe is for a quick strawberry banana smoothie - perfect for the summer
            for a nice refresher or after you go to the gym! This recipe is easy to make
            with 4 simple ingredients in less than 5 minutes. Definitely my go-to smoothie!
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Frozen strawbeerries</li>
            <li>Fresh bananas or frozen bananas</li>
            <li>Milk (any type)</li>
            <li>Ice (however much is needed for desired consistency)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Optional Variations</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Vanilla: If you want extra flavor, you can add in a 1/2 teaspoon or so 
                of vanilla extract.
            </li>
            <li>Greek yogurt: You can also add 1/2 cup of plain (or vanilla) Greek
                yogurt to make the smoothie a little more creamy.
            </li>
            <li>Powders: You can also add a scoop of protein, acai, or maca powder.</li>
            <li>Greens: Toss in a large handful of fresh baby spinach or kale to
                make it a green smoothie (if you want to feel healthy)
            </li>
            <li>Honey: I personally like to add a scoop or two of honey to add some flavor!</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add all ingredients to a blender.</li>
            <li>Blend until smooth. If the smoothie seems to thick, add in a bit
                of extra milk or water. If it seems too thin, add in more strawbeerries
                or banana.
            </li>
            <li>Pour the smoothie into a serving glass or two and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
