        <p>This recipe is an avocado toast, one of my favorite quick and easy to make
            breakfasts. This will contain a basic recipe with some tips and variations
            to try out. :D
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <p>Just toast and avocado! Different ingredients may be needed 
                depending on the variation being made.</p>
        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Mashed avocado is more creamy and luxurious than sliced avocado.</li>
            <li>You'll want to mix in at least a pinch of salt per avocado half.</li>
            <li>Add garlic: Lightly rub a peeled raw garlic clove over the top of your
                toast before adding the avocado, or mix a tiny pinch of garlic powder
                into the avocado.
            </li>
            <li>Put an egg on it!</li>
            <li>Try with some hot sauce!</li>
